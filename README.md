## 🌸 RinAI: Your Evolving AI Companion

**RinAI** is a memory-augmented, personality-rich AI chatbot and Discord bot. RinAI remembers facts about users, evolves her personality, and adapts her quirks and traits based on your interactions. She supports both a web chat interface and Discord, can generate and receive voice responses, and features a Live2D animated avatar.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🧠 Long-Term Memory:** Remembers user facts, preferences, and conversation history across sessions.
- **🎭 Dynamic Personality:** Evolves traits and quirks based on user interactions and extracted facts.
- **💬 Web Chat UI:** WhatsApp-inspired chat interface with timestamps and voice playback.
- **🎤 Voice Input & Output:** Talk to RinAI using your voice and receive spoken responses (gTTS-powered).
- **🤖 Discord Bot:** Chat with RinAI directly in your Discord server using `!rin` prefix.
- **🗣️ Voice Synthesis:** Generates voice responses using gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech).
- **⏰ Time Awareness:** Adapts responses based on time since last interaction (see [`app/routes.py`](app/routes.py), [`app/memory.py`](app/memory.py)).
- **📚 Fact Extraction:** Learns and stores facts about users from conversations, with persistent storage.
- **🔗 Embedding Memory:** Uses sentence-transformers for semantic memory and context retrieval.
- **📝 Persistent Storage:** Stores memory, facts, and personality in JSON and CSV files.
- **🌈 Customizable Personality:** Easily tweakable via `personality.json` and user facts.
- **🎵 Audio & Songs:** Supports audio responses and song playback (see `audio/` and `songs/` folders).
